We can perform a pitch, but we can\\u2019t really perform a pitch class. We\\u2019ve seen similar examples in the intervallic realm. Ordered pitch intervals are associated with a very specific sound (e.g., +15); unordered pitch-class intervals (e.g., interval class 1) are less vivid or real. A basic concept in pitch-class set theory is that these levels of concreteness and abstractness encompass not only pitch and interval, but groups of pitch classes as well. These groups of pitch classes are called \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"pitch-class sets\"), \".\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We\\u2019ve already seen sets of pitch-classes, though we haven\\u2019t really been calling them that.

As we\\u2019ve seen in class, one very interesting way of looking at a lot of post-tonal music is by studying the \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"../transposition/\"\n  }), \"transpositional\"), \" and \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"../inversion/\"\n  }), \"inversional\"), \" relationships between pitch-class sets.

This is most easily grasped by remembering that all major and minor triads have the same interval content (M3, m3, and P5). Major triads are transpositionally related to one another, while major and minor triads are inversionally related to one another.
